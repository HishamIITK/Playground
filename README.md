The Final Phase of the Project:\n
We have developed a Scientific calculator which can do the following operations on the two numbers a and b given in the input:\n
1) a^b modulo 4999\n
2) logarithm of "a" to the base "b"\n
3) gcd of a,b\n
4) lcm of a,b\n
5) a power 1/b\n

The interface shows all the instructions for the users to operate the Scientific Calculator. Users can refer to the interface and continue using the calculator.\n
