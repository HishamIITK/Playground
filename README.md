The Final Phase of the Project:
We have developed a Scientific calculator which can do the following operations on the two numbers a and b given in the input:
1) a^b modulo 4999
2) logarithm of "a" to the base "b"
3) gcd of a,b
4) lcm of a,b
5) a power 1/b

The interface shows all the instructions for the users to operate the Scientific Calculator. Users can refer to the interface and continue using the calculator.
